ChipScoPy Installation
======================

ChipScoPy requires an installed Python. There are several ways to configure your system with Python. We recommend and document the 
`Basic Python Installation`_.


Basic Python Installation
-------------------------

This section covers installing the Python base interpreter. Two options for obtaining a suitable Python are noted in this section. 

- `Option 1 - Dedicated Python`_ is for users who are able to download and install the official Python. This is the recommended approach.

- `Option 2 - Vivado Distributed Python`_ describes how to use the Python bundled with Vivado. 

A single version of Python will execute ChipScoPy--ergo, do not install multiple Pythons via different methods.

.. warning:: **NEVER** invoke ``sudo`` to install Python packages. Installing Python packages with ``sudo`` can accidentally overwrite existing system files.

Option 1 - Dedicated Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the recommended installation procedure to get the latest available Python interpreter from Python.org.

To install Python, navigate to:
`<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. Locate and install the latest Python 3.8 or newer for your operating system.

.. note:: Make sure to check the box to add Python to the PATH during installation.


Option 2 - Vivado Distributed Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Beginning in 2021.1, the unified Vivado installer will deliver a suitable Python during the install operation. This Python is located at the following operating system-dependent locations:

**Linux:**

.. code-block:: shell

   /path_to_xilinx_tools/Vivado/<ver>/tps/lnx64/python-<ver>
   e.g.:
   /opt/xilinx/Vivado/2021.1/tps/lnx64/python-3.8.3

   To use this Python, set your path and loader path by (bash syntax):
   export PATH=$PATH:/opt/xilinx/Vivado/2021.1/tps/lnx64/python-3.8.3/bin
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/xilinx/Vivado/2021.1/tps/lnx64/python-3.8.3/lib


**Windows**

.. code-block:: shell

   <drive_spec>:\path_to_xilinx_tools\Vivado\<ver>\tps\win64\python-<ver>
   e.g.:
   C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2021.1\tps\win64\python-3.8.3

   To use this Python, amend this to your user or system-wide %PATH% environment variable
   C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2021.1\tps\win64\python-3.8.3\bin


Virtual Environments 
--------------------

A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment. It allows ChipScoPy and its dependencies to be installed without interfering with the behavior of any other Python applications. The use of virtual environments is best practice.

For more information about Python virtual environments, check out the official
`Python Virtual Environment Documentation <https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/venv.html>`_.

.. note:: Linux systems often name the python command 'python3' instead of 'python'. In that case, substitute 'python3' as needed in the commands below.
          

The following will create a virtual environment sandbox and install python into the virtual environment. 

Installation assumes you are using bash on linux, or the PowerShell on Windows. The Windows PowerShell can be accessed by right clicking on the start menu and selecting "Windows PowerShell".


.. code-block:: shell

    > python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment. The location of the activate script is different depending on operating system. 

Windows:

.. code-block:: shell

    > venv/Scripts/activate

Linux:

.. code-block:: shell

    > venv/bin/activate


.. note:: Make sure to always activate the Python virtual environment before you use ChipScoPy.


Install ChipScoPy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's time to install the ChipScoPy package itself. With your Python environment active run:

.. code-block:: shell

    # installs latest version 
    (chipscopy) > python -m pip install chipscopy


If you want to install a specific version, run:

.. code-block:: shell

    # installs latest version of 2021.1
    (chipscopy) > python -m pip install chipscopy==2021.1.*   


Install Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the virtual environment active you may want to install some additional packages that aren't listed in the ChipScoPy project-level dependencies. If you intend to use any of these client examples, then youâ€™ll need to get additional packages.

Run the following commands to install the additional support packages:

.. code-block:: shell

    (chipscopy) > python -m pip install chipscopy[core-addons]
    (chipscopy) > python -m pip install chipscopy[jupyter]


Congrats--if you're still awake and you've followed the steps till here, you are the proud owner of a functional Python setup. Next steps are to start exploring the examples.


Install ChipScoPy Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that the ChipScoPy package has been installed, there is a script to install the examples into a particular directory chosen by the user.

.. code-block:: shell

    (chipscopy) > chipscopy-get-examples

    The following examples  will be delivered to `/home/user/chipscopy-examples`:
    - ddr_example.ipynb
    - ddr_example.py
    - basic_detect.py
    ...


Make note of the location to which these are extracted. This location contains example python code and example designs.


Starting Jupyter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assuming you installed the ``jupyter`` package into your virtual environment, you can use the notebooks provided with the examples.

Launch the server:

.. code-block:: shell

    (chipscopy) > jupyter notebook


This should launch the server in a browser window on your local machine. Follow the instructions and  navigate to the directory to which you deployed the ChipScoPy examples. Run any of the notebooks included with the release.


ChipScoPy Updates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As the development team pushes fixes and features; ``pip``, again, is the recommended tool for grabbing the latest software.

.. code-block:: shell

    (chipscopy) > python -m pip install --upgrade chipscopy


To get the latest software for a specific release (2021.1 in this example):

.. code-block:: shell

    (chipscopy) > python -m pip install --upgrade chipscopy==2021.1.*


And don't forget to extract the latest examples after each package update:

.. code-block:: shell

    (chipscopy) > chipscopy-get-examples
