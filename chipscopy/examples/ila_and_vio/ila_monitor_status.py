# # ChipScoPy ILA Monitor Status Example
#
#
# <img src="../img/api_overview.png" width="500" align="left">

# %% [markdown]
# ## Description
# An advanced example showing how to monitor the ILA capture status, by running the function ILA.monitor_status(), in asynchroneous mode.
#
# By calling ChipScoPy ILA API function **monitor_status()**, in asynchronous mode we can do the following:
# - Get periodic updates of ILA core capture status.
# - Call other ChipScoPy API functions, while monitoring the ILA status.
# - Cancel the status monitor early.
#
#
# ## Requirements
# - Local or remote Xilinx Versal board, such as a VCK190
# - Xilinx hw_server 2023.2 installed and running
# - Xilinx cs_server 2023.2 installed and running
# - Python 3.8 or greater installed
# - ChipScoPy 2023.2 installed
# - Jupyter notebook support installed - Please do so, using the command `pip install chipscopy[jupyter]`

# --------------------

# %% [markdown]
# ## A. Function monitor_status()
#
#     def monitor_status(
#        self, max_wait_minutes: float = None, progress=None, done: request.DoneFutureCallback = None
#     ) -> ILAStatus or request.CsFutureRequestSync:
#
# This function monitors ILA capture status and waits until all data has been captured, or until timeout
# or the function is cancelled.
# Call this function after arming the ILA and before uploading the waveform.
# The command operates in synchronous mode if *done* argument has default value *None* .
#
#
# Args:
# -  **max_wait_minutes** (float): Max time in minutes for status monitor. If *None*, status monitor never times out.
# -  **progress**(progress_fn) : See Asynchronous Mode, below. This function runs in the TCF Event Thread.
# -  **done**(request.DoneFutureCallback): Done callback. This function runs in the TCF Event Thread.
#
# Returns:
# - ILAStatus when called synchronously.
# - "future object" when called asynchronously.

# %% [markdown]
# ## B. Calling monitor_status() in Synchronous Mode
# - Typical mode when using this function. It is not covered in this example.
# - Function waits until all data has been captured in the ILA core, or timeout.
# - Use default argument value *None* for both arguments *progress* and *done* .
# - Returns an ILAStatus object.

# %% [markdown]
# ## C. Calling monitor_status() in Asynchronous Mode
#
# - This mode is useful for reporting the capture status to stdout or a GUI.
# - Function does not block. The main thread continues with the next statement.
# - Returns a *future* object, which represents the monitor.
# - A blocking function should be called later on the *future* object, in order to let the calling thread wait until the status monitor has completed.
# - Asynchronous Mode is selected, by specifying a *done* function, which is called after the function has completed.
# - If no user defined callback is needed, set *done* argument to dummy function *chipscopy.null_callback*, to enable asynchronous mode.

# %% [markdown]
# ## D. Future Object
#
# When the *monitor_status* function is called in asynchronous mode, it will return a *future* object.
# The *future* object has blocking attributes and functions, which will block the current thread until
# the status monitor has completed.
#
# ###  Blocking Attributes
#
# - *future.result* - Returns *None* or *ILAStatus*. *ILAStatus* object if capture did complete successfully, without timeout.
# - *future.error* - Returns *None* or *Exception*. *None* if no error otherwise an exception object, e.g. timeout exception.
#
# ### Non-blocking Attribute
#
# - *future.progress* - Returns *None* or *ILAStatus*. Read this attribute in the *progress function*, to get the ILA capture status.
#
# ### Blocking Function
#
# - *future.wait(timeout=None)* - *None* value means wait until status monitor completes. Argument *timeout* is in seconds.
#
# ### Non-blocking Function
#
# - *future.cancel()*  - Cancels the status monitor. An exception will be raised in the thread, which called the function *ILA.monitor_status*.

# %% [markdown]
# ## E. Progress Function
#
# - User-defined function which takes one argument *future*.
# - Useful for reporting ILA capture status.
# - The *progress function* is only called when the ILA capture status changes.
# - The *progress function* is called in the TCF Event Thread. The *progress function* must not call any ChipScoPy API function, which interacts with the cs_server or the device.
#
# >    Example:
# >
# >        def monitor_status_done(future):
# >            if not future.error:
# >                # future.result holds an ILAStatus object.
# >                print_status(future.progress)

# %% [markdown]

# ## 1 - Initialization: Imports and File Paths
#
# After this step,
# - Required functions and classes are imported
# - URL paths are set correctly
# - File paths to example files are set correctly

# The session is a container that keeps track of devices and debug cores.
# After this step,
# - Session is initialized and connected to server(s)
# - Versions are detected and reported to stdout

# Debug core discovery initializes the chipscope server debug cores. This brings debug cores in the chipscope server online.

#
# ILA and VIO are two important building blocks for debugging applications in hardware.
# This example design shows how to control IP using a VIO core and capture results with ILA.
#
# In this design,
# - A VIO core controls the counter (reset, up/down, ce, load)
# - An ILA core captures the counter values
#

# %% [markdown]
# <img src="img/capture_data.png" width="400" align="left">

# %%
# Grab the two cores we are interested in for the demonstration
# As shown above, a counter is connected to the ILA core.
# The VIO core controls the counter.

#
# Set up the VIO core to enable counting up, from 0

# %% [markdown]
# ## 7 - Define Status Progress Function
# - The **status_progress** function will be given to the **ila.monitor_status()** function, as an argument.
# - The function is called when status changes, but not more often than twice per second.
# - The argument **future** has a member *progress* of type **ILAStatus**, which contains the status information.
# - The **status_progress** function,
#     - prints status to stdout
#     - cancels the **monitor_status()** function, if 3 waveform windows have been captured.
# - Note: The monitor function will run in the Event Tread, which handles commands sent to the cs_server.
# - Important: Do not call an API function which communicates with the cs_server or device, from inside the monitor function. It may put the program in a deadlock.

#
# - Set ILA to trigger when UP/DOWN counter signal edge rises or falls.
# - Set ILA core to capture on a transition of the UP/DOWN toggle switch
# - Once transition happens, trigger in the middle of the buffer.
# - Request 10 windows.

# ## 10 - Toggle Counter Direction - Monitor Status
# - Use VIO to toggle counter up/down switch 3 times: DOWN/UP/DOWN.
# - This will cause the running ILA to trigger 3 times, capturing 3 windows of data.
# - The *status_progress* function will call *future.cancel()*, after 3 windows.
# - Observe messages:
#     - *status_progress* prints capture status.
#     - *status_progress* prints out message when calling *future.cancel()*.
#     - *done* function *monitor_status_done* prints message when called.
