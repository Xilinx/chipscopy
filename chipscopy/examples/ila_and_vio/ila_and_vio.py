# # ChipScoPy ILA and VIO Example
#
#
# <img src="../img/api_overview.png" width="500" align="left">

# %% [markdown]
# ## Description
# This example demonstrates how to program and communicate with ILA (Integrated Logic Analyzer) and
# VIO (Virtual IO) cores using the ChipScoPy Python API.
#
#
# ## Requirements
# - Local or remote Xilinx Versal board, such as a VCK190
# - Xilinx hw_server 2022.2 installed and running
# - Xilinx cs_server 2022.2 installed and running
# - Python 3.8 or greater installed
# - ChipScoPy 2022.2 installed
# - Jupyter notebook support installed - Please do so, using the command `pip install chipscopy[jupyter]`

# %% [markdown]
# ## 1 - Initialization: Imports and File Paths
#
# After this step,
# - Required functions and classes are imported
# - URL paths are set correctly
# - File paths to example files are set correctly

# %%
import sys
import os
from chipscopy import get_design_files
from chipscopy import create_session, report_versions

# %%
# Make sure to start the hw_server and cs_server prior to running.
# Specify locations of the running hw_server and cs_server below.
# The default is localhost - but can be other locations on the network.
CS_URL = os.getenv("CS_SERVER_URL", "TCP:localhost:3042")
HW_URL = os.getenv("HW_SERVER_URL", "TCP:localhost:3121")

# The get_design_files() function tries to find the PDI and LTX files. In non-standard
# configurations, you can put the path for PROGRAMMING_FILE and PROBES_FILE below.
design_files = get_design_files("vck190/production/chipscopy_ced")

PROGRAMMING_FILE = design_files.programming_file
PROBES_FILE = design_files.probes_file

print(f"HW_URL: {HW_URL}")
print(f"CS_URL: {CS_URL}")
print(f"PROGRAMMING_FILE: {PROGRAMMING_FILE}")
print(f"PROBES_FILE:{PROBES_FILE}")


# %% [markdown]
# ## 2 - Create a session and connect to the hw_server and cs_server
#
# The session is a container that keeps track of devices and debug cores.
# After this step,
# - Session is initialized and connected to server(s)
# - Versions are detected and reported to stdout

# %%
session = create_session(cs_server_url=CS_URL, hw_server_url=HW_URL)
report_versions(session)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 3 - Program the device with the example design
#
# After this step,
# - Device is programmed with the example programming file

# %%
# Typical case - one device on the board - get it.
device = session.devices.filter_by(family="versal").get()
device.program(PROGRAMMING_FILE)


# %% [markdown]
# ## 4 - Discover Debug Cores
#
# Debug core discovery initializes the chipscope server debug cores. This brings debug cores in the chipscope server online.
#
# After this step,
#
# - The cs_server is initialized and ready for use
# - ILA and VIO core instances in the device are reported

# %%
device.discover_and_setup_cores(ltx_file=PROBES_FILE)
print(f"Debug cores setup and ready for use.")

# %%
# Print out the ILA core instance UUIDs and instance names
ila_cores = device.ila_cores
for index, ila_core in enumerate(ila_cores):
    print(f"{index} - {ila_core.core_info.uuid}   {ila_core.name}")

# %%
# Print out the VIO core instance UUIDs and instance names
vio_cores = device.vio_cores
for index, vio_core in enumerate(vio_cores):
    print(f"{index} - {vio_core.core_info.uuid}   {vio_core.name}")


# %% [markdown]
# ## 5 - VIO Control and ILA Capture
#
# ILA and VIO are two important building blocks for debugging applications in hardware.
# This example design design shows how to control IP using a VIO core and capture results with ILA.
#
# In this Design,
# - A VIO core controls the counter (reset, up/down, ce, load)
# - An ILA core captures the counter values
#

# %% [markdown]
# <img src="img/capture_data.png" width="400" align="left">

# %%
# Grab the two cores we are interested in for the demonstration
# As shown above, a counter is connected to the ILA core.
# The VIO core controls the counter.

ila = device.ila_cores.get(name="chipscopy_i/counters/ila_slow_counter_0")
vio = device.vio_cores.get(name="chipscopy_i/counters/vio_slow_counter_0")

print(f"Using ILA: {ila.core_info.uuid}  {ila.name}")
print(f"Using VIO: {vio.core_info.uuid}  {vio.name}")


# %% [markdown]
# ### 5a - Configure the counter using VIO output probes
#
# <img src="img/vio_control_counter.png" width="300" align="left">

# %%
# Print all the VIO port and probe names. This is convenient to know which probes are connected to
# VIO ports. Also verifies probe names to pass to other functions.

print("VIO Port <---> Probe mapping:")
for probe in vio.probes:
    if probe.direction == "in":
        print(f"{probe.port_name} <-- {probe.probe_name}")
    else:
        print(f"{probe.port_name} --> {probe.probe_name}")

# %%
# Set up the VIO core to enable counting up from 0
#
vio.reset_vio()

        "chipscopy_i/counters/slow_counter_0_CE": 1,
    }

print("Counter is now free-running and counting up")

# %% [markdown]
# ### 5b - Capture and display free-running counter using the ILA core
#
# <img src="img/free_running_counter.png" width="350" align="left">

# %%
# Trigger ILA on the free running counter. Trigger set to the first time we see 0s in low 16-bits.
# This will show the counter is free running, and counting up

ila.reset_probes()
ila.set_probe_trigger_value("chipscopy_i/counters/slow_counter_0_Q_1", ["==", "0xXXXX_0000"])
ila.run_basic_trigger(window_count=1, window_size=32, trigger_position=16)
print("ILA is running - looking for trigger")

# %%
# Wait for the ILA trigger with upload.
# Then print the captured ILA samples and mark the trigger position.

ila.wait_till_done(max_wait_minutes=0.1)

    print("Failed to upload ILA data from core")

# %% [markdown]
# ### 5c - Trigger ILA using VIO Up/Down virtual switch
#
# This step demonstrates how VIO and ILA can be combined to form powerful debug building blocks.
#
# ILA is set to trigger when UP/DOWN counter signal edge rises or falls.
# VIO drives the UP/DOWN counter control signal to 0 causing the counter to count down.
# The signal transition causes ILA to trigger and capture data.
#
# After this step,
# - VIO drives counter to count from UP to DOWN
# - ILA triggers on the UP to DOWN signal transition
# - Waveform uploaded with the up/down trigger sample in the center of captured data
#

# %% [markdown]
# <img src="img/edge_trigger.png" width="550" align="left">

# %%
# Set ILA core to capture on a transition of the UP/DOWN toggle switch
# Once transition happens, trigger in the middle of the buffer.

print("ILA is running - looking for trigger")

# %%
# VIO: Turn counter up/down switch to DOWN position.
# This will cause the running ILA to trigger on the transition edge from up to down.

vio.write_probes({"chipscopy_i/counters/slow_counter_0_UP": 0})

print("VIO changed up/down counter to count down")

# %%
# Print the captured ILA samples and mark the trigger position.
# Note that counter counts down after the trigger mark.
