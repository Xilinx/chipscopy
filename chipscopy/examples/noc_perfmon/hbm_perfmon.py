# <img src="../img/api_overview.png" width="500" align="left">

# %% [markdown]
# ## Description
# This example demonstrates how to configure a Versal for taking NoC performance measurements.
# 
# ## Requirements
# - Local or remote Xilinx Versal HBM2E board/part, for example VHK158
# - Xilinx hw_server 2022.2 installed and running
# - Xilinx cs_server 2022.2 installed and running
# - Python 3.8 or greater installed
# - ChipScoPy 2022.2 installed
# - Jupyter notebook support installed - Please do so, using the command `pip install chipscopy[jupyter]`
# - Matplotlib support installed - Please do so, using the command `pip install chipscopy[core-addons]`

# %% [markdown]
# ## 1 - Initialization: Imports and File Paths
# 
# After this step,
# - Required functions and classes are imported
# - Paths to server(s) and files are set correctly

# %%
import os
from time import sleep
import matplotlib  # for nbconvert'd script
from chipscopy.api.noc import (
    TC_BEW,
    TC_BER,
    NoCPerfMonNodeListener,
)
from chipscopy.api.noc.plotting_utils import MeasurementPlot
from chipscopy import create_session, report_versions
from chipscopy import get_design_files


# %%
# Make sure to start the hw_server and cs_server prior to running.
# Specify locations of the running hw_server and cs_server below.
# The default is localhost - but can be other locations on the network.
CS_URL = os.getenv("CS_SERVER_URL", "TCP:localhost:3042")
HW_URL = os.getenv("HW_SERVER_URL", "TCP:localhost:3121")

print("INFO: HBM design not included in chipscopy, user must provide design!!")

print(f"HW_URL: {HW_URL}")
print(f"CS_URL: {CS_URL}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2 - Create a session and connect to the hw_server and cs_server
# 
# The session is a container that keeps track of devices and debug cores.
# After this step,
# - Session is initialized and connected to server(s)
# - Versions are detected and reported to stdout

# %%
session = create_session(cs_server_url=CS_URL, hw_server_url=HW_URL)
report_versions(session)


# %% [markdown]
# ## 3 - Select the device and program
# 
# After this step,
# - Device is programmed with the example programming file (for this example the user must supply the design)

# %%
versal_device = session.devices.filter_by(family="versal").get()
# use this to program your design
# versal_device.program("filename.pdi")


# %% [markdown]
# ## 4 - Discover Debug Cores
# 
# Debug core discovery initializes the chipscope server debug cores. This brings debug cores in the chipscope server online.
# 
# After this step,
# 
# - The cs_server is initialized and ready for use

# %%
versal_device.discover_and_setup_cores(
    noc_scan=True, ila_scan=False, vio_scan=False, pcie_scan=False
)
print(f"Debug cores setup and ready for use.")


# %% [markdown]
# ## 5 - Setup NoC core
# 
# Ensure scan nodes are enabled in the design.
# 
# We begin by enumerating the debug cores (hard and soft) present in the design.
# Then we ask the design for the supported timebases. And, finally:
# The NoC is scanned to determine the activated elements.

# %%
nocs = versal_device.noc_core
base_noc = nocs[0]
print(base_noc.name)


# %%
# this will setup the nodes on the server side and return the nodes successfully enumerated
# print("Discovering NoC, this may take some time...")
# hbm_enable_list = base_noc.discover_noc_elements()
# or enumerate!

# %% [markdown]
# Select Timebase and Nodes to Monitor
# 
# For the various clock domains we must select a sampling period from the hardware supported values. The debug cable used will dictate how much bandwidth is available, so high frequency sampling may not actually produce data at the specified rate. Recommendation is ~500ms for jtag.
# 
# Then the user must decide what to monitor--again the bandwidth is a definite consideration here. Plot performance may become the bottleneck (Optimizations will come later in the renderer or agg backend). The guidance here is to pick up to 4 nodes to monitor.

# %%
desired_period = 500  # ms
sampling_intervals = {}

for domain in supported_periods.keys():
    sampling_intervals[domain] = 0
    for sp in supported_periods[domain]:
        if sp >= desired_period:
            sampling_intervals[domain] = sp
            break

    if sampling_intervals[domain] == 0:
        print(
            f"Warning, desired period {desired_period}ms is slower than "
            f"longest supported period {supported_periods[domain][-1]}ms [{domain} domain] "
            f"defaulting to this value."

print(f"Sampling period selection:")

# %% [markdown]
# ##  6 - Configure Monitors
# 
# As a precaution, it's a good idea to validate the desired nodes are enabled for the design.
# Using the set of nodes and the desired sampling periods it's time to ask the service to start pushing metric data. Two additional arguments are required to this API.
# 
# Traffic class
# 
# This is a bit-or field of the requested traffic classes. Note, One monitor is dedicated to read traffic classes and the other to write--so all read TCs will apply to one channel and all write TCs to the other. `Best effort` is a good place to start.
# 
# Number of Samples
# 
# The number of samples allows for a burst of measurements to be taken and then the underlying service will tear down the monitors and stop pumping data back to the client. `-1` denotes that sampling shall continue indefinitely.

# %%
# total number of samples to capture (-1 for continuous mode)
num_samples = -1

enable_list = hbm_enable_list

# When overflow occurs the precision of the monitors must be traded for range
